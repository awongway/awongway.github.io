summary: Summer Baseball League
---
Over the summer I participated in an adult baseball league (OBL). Our team name is called "MoRuns". The team has been in existence for the past 12 seasons prior to the 2018 season. This past summer was my second season with the team. The goal of each season is to ultimatley have fun, but also develope teamwork to work together and win each game and hopefully the tournament. The MoRuns team only had 2 championships prior to this season. With the addition of a few new guys, the outcome for this season seemed pretty high, but you never know for sure. 

Our team consisted of ages ranging from 16 to 50 years old. We had power, speed, and finesse. We just needed to use those facotrs wisely if we wanted to come out on top. By the time the regular part of the season finisehd, we were at the bottom of the league, therefore we were the last seed in the tournament. For us to win the championship, we would need to give it everything we had.

And we did. We ended winning the D2 tournament and claiming our third championship for the MoRun team.
