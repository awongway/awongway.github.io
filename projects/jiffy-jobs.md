summary: Final Project for ICS 314
---
For this semester, our final for ICS 314 was to create a functional website. The task of the site was given to each team by our instructor. Ours had to be circuled around finding a job. In our group of 4, we split the tasks into multiple parts and throught three milestones we were able to complete the task. Below are two links. The first being to our github page were we go into more depth about the process and feedback we received during our project. The second link is our working site hosted on galaxy.
