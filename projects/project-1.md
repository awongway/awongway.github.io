Photography is something I have been interested in for quite a while now. It all started during my junior year of highschool when I took a Digital Photography class. Since then I took another semester during my Senior year and now have been shooting for fun for the past 2 years out of highschool. Some of my favorite things to shoot is Portraits and sports.
