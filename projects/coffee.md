summary: This was my first Photo Essay for Ka Leo.
---
I started Ka Leo during my Fall Semester of 2017. When I joined I had no previous experince working in the news industy. It was all new to me and I was just putting my foot through the door. My first assignment was to go to local coffee shops and create a [Photo Essay](http://www.manoanow.org/kaleo/photos/coffee-tea/article_77ef2b60-9287-11e7-bc56-e3d3480c7dae.html) to document the reasons students should go there. After I took the photos, I submitted them with captions and a short summary. It eventually made its way to being published on the site. It gained a good amount of attraction and would eventually win me second place in the Student Media Board (SMB) Awards for the category of photo essay.
