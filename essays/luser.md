## My Background
Oh Java, one of the many languages of the programming world. People have their pros and cons on why they pick a certain language when it coems to coding. They know what works for them and what doesn't. However for me, I've only coded on Java explictly. I have not tried any other lagnuage besides Java. Is that a good thing you may ask? Im not sure yet, however from what I've done so far, I'm a fan of Java. 

During my first couple of ICS courses, I used the application Eclipse to write code. It was a good program that would tell you where you would go wrong. It was a bit difficult to set up, but it was worth it in the end. I completed a few projects with Java on Eclipse and was happy with the results. After then, that leads me to about a week ago when I started to code using a website called jsFiddle([https://jsfiddle.net]). This is a Java coding site based online where you are able to write code and store it online. 

## jsFiddle so far...
So far my experience with this site is both good and bad. The part I liked is that the setup was very easy. All I had to do was type the url in my favorite browser and I could start coding. There was no additional installations or programs required which was relief. The only downside I have so far it that I don't know where exactly my "saved" code goes. Everytime I save my code, I cant seem to find it. The work around this is just for me to save the url, that way I'm always able to access it.

## Java Now
Since the last time I used Java to now, I have learned a bit more stuff. One of them being the difference between the declaration var and let/const. It didnt take me long to get used to using let instead of var. A very small change but nothing I cant handle.
