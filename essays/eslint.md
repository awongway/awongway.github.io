## ESLint Pros
In class we have been using ESLint for the past week. Prior to this I had no experience with the plug-in. As expressed in the title, everything with ESLint has been "EZ" so far. One of the perks from using this add ons is that it finds problems with my code without me needing to execute it. This saves me a lot of time from trying to run it. The green checkmark is also very useful to me. It helps speed up my process and points out where there is a fault in my code.

## Cons
As much as ESLint it helpful, there are a few cons to it. One is that before writing my code, it needs a lot of setting up. When using IntelliJ, there are a lot of options to customize your developer experience. Options are good, but also makes it very complicated when you don't care too much about them. So when I want to use ESLint, I have to enable it every time before writing my code. Since IntelliJ is more complicated, it just takes longer to setup and load. This can be problematic if all you want to do is write a quick code. Programs like jsfiddle will speed up your process much faster, except it won't have ESLint

## Summary
Overall I am happy with ESLint, but not a fan of IntelliJ. Hopefully as the class goes on, I will grow to enjoy IntelliJ and its plethora of features. However for now, I would choose jsfiddle for the simplicity factor.
