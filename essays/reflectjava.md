## A
As another assignment for ICS 314, we had to create a bunch of different accounts to help our future. A few where Linked, Slack, TechHui, and last but not least the one you're on now, GitHub. By far GitHub for me was personally the hardest for me to set-up. However at the same time it was probably the most fun site to build. With so many options and code, the possibilties seem endless. This is both GitHubs prized posseesion and most confusing part of the system. I found setting up GitHub to be difficult and rather annoying. Just like regular code, if you mess up one thing, the site will not work. I hope to continue to use GitHub as it is a good place to store your resume, link to other projects, showcase your essays, and many more.
